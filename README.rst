A command-line tool to download, manage and convert fonts
=========================================================

fonty is a command line interface that helps you simplify your font management
workflow by allowing you to install and uninstall fonts like a package manager
(think npm, apt-get, chocolatey). It can also help you create webfonts and
generate @font-face declarations so that you can focus on building great
websites.
